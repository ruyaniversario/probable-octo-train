  <h2>Siargao</h2>
  <p>
    Siargao made its first claim to fame as the Philippines’ surfing capital, and recently as the “Best Island in the World” (awarded by Condé Nast readers for 2018).This paradise has been on my favorites list ever since my first trip to the island a decade ago. What impressed me the most were the enchanting lagoons of Sohoton Cove, a natural wonder that’s well worth the 2-hour detour from the Cloud 9 surfing beach. The main island is filled with pristine natural spots as well, including white sand beaches, stunning islets, vast coconut forests, cool tidal pools & more.

  <h2>Coron</h2>
  <p>
    In contrast to El Nido’s amazing “over water” views, go to Coron for spectacular underwater views. Here, you can see colorful coral gardens, pristine waters, lots of marine life, and even sunken WWII Japanese shipwrecks. Don’t get me wrong, Coron can hold its own when it comes to scenic views over the water as well. This paradise is home to hidden emerald/blue lagoons surrounded by limestone cliffs. There’s no shortage of incredibly beautiful fine white sand beaches in Coron either.

  <h2>Cebu</h2>
  <p>
    Cebu is the country’s #1 most visited tourist destination, and for good reason. It is unrivaled in offering the widest range of things to do and attractions. Cebu is like the “Jack of all trades” among tourist spots in the Philippines.

  <h2>Balabac Islands</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re looking for the best beaches & most vibrant waters in the Philippines, look nowhere else. Balabac is worth a spot at the VERY TOP of your bucketlist. Balabac is the southernmost group of islands in Palawan. It is so far south that Sabah, in East Malaysia is nearer to Balabac than Puerto Princesa, the provincial capital of Palawan.

  <h2>Batanes Islands</h2>
  <p>
    Batanes is the northernmost province of the Philippines. These remote islands are shaped by volcanic forces and strong typhoons. The natural landscape of Batanes is distinct from other parts of the Philippines. Here, you’ll find vibrant green rolling hills, grazing cows, steep seaside cliffs, sparkling clear blue waters, traditional stone houses, and iconic lighthouses.

  <h2>Sagada</h2>
  <p>
    Surrounded by spectacular mountain views, Sagada is most-known for the bizarre hanging coffins, a burial tradition that has survived for over 2,000 years. When in town, don’t miss the cave connection tour (Sumaging-Lumiang Cave), sunrise view from above a sea of clouds at Kiltepan Peak, the local coffee (best in PH) & hike to the many waterfalls in the area including Bomod-ok Falls and Pongas Falls.
